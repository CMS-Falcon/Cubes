# Cubes

Cubes is a real-time, 3D application. 3D Cubes are rendered on the screen using the Three.js library (WebGL) and can be moved using the arrow keys. Every player connected to the page has their own cube, and can see the cubes of all the other players moving in real-time. This is achieved by using TCP communication through WebSockets (uWS library). I hope to add a simple game functionality in the future.
